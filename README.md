# Basic-Sorting-Algorithms-Comparison
This repository contains C++ implementations of various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. These algorithms are commonly used to efficiently arrange elements in an array or list.

# Instructions

In order to be able to run the code you will need and integrated development enviroment (IDE) for C++, for example Code::Blocks or VSCode

1. Download the ZIP file from this repository where you will find all the algorithms.

2. Open the Project in Code::Blocks :
Launch Code::Blocks IDE and open the rand_numb.cpp file located in the zip file.

3. Run the program:
Build and run the rand_numb.cpp file and input how many random numbers you want it to generate, this will create a rand_numb.txt file containing n random numbers.

4. Open one of the sorting algorithms and run it:
Open whichever one of the 5 provded algorithms and run it, this will create a sorted_numbers file where all the elements will be sorted.

5. View the results: 
After running one of the sorting algorithms all numbers from random_numb.txt file will be automatically sorted in sorted_numbers.txt.
